#JavaScript Snake Game

A javascript snake Game that I am working on from memory with no tutorial help.

(except looking up the docs and using old projects)

I could not figure out how to make the tail of the snake.

I used a youtube video to help, though it was not a copy and paste job, so that must count for something right?

I added menus for starting, pausing and game over. Honestly the design is terrible, I will refine when I finishe the point system . Please don't jusdge me

I Added the point system and finally picked out a pallet to use. There are probably still some bugs and the options menu does not work, yet

For the Game over screen, I want to have it "fall" from the top and bounce on the bottom, causeing the whole middle container to move as it hits.
